			<h3>Marie Christine Peterson</h3>
			<p>
				For more than 35 years, Marie has developed an enviable reputation for creating sophisticated, yet comfortable environments. Marie's career began with a family tradition of travel, study and observation of the decorative arts and architecture. Throughout her life she has traveled throughout Europe, Asia, South and Central America. All of these experiences finely honed Marie's understanding and appreciation of different regional and period aesthetics. This was the beginning of her education in creating refined interiors spanning the contemporary to traditional aesthetics of design.
				<br>
				<br>
				Employing a supporting team of talented professionals, Marie delivers an unsurpassed level of service and personal attention to her diverse projects. Her frequently published work encompasses elegant country estates, exotic island getaways, and luxurious contemporary apartments.
				<br>
				<br>
				Alongside Marie's broad lifestyle experience within art, fine antiques, and design aesthetics, Marie also pursued a formal education in the technical aspects of her trade, obtaining a B.S. Degree from San Jose State University in Interior Design in 1979. "To me, being a professional requires more than simply having the right sense of style. It also means mastering the 'nuts and bolts' of design, including the latest in technology, materials and architecture. It's this combination of experience that enables a designer to deliver not just beautiful results but also value to the client."
